# Peiyang-NLP-Project
## Brief introduction to this project

This project is conducted by Peiyang Song (he/him/his), an undergrad of CCS Computing in his first year. In view of his multilingual nature, this project focuses at least a little more on Mandarin NLP, but not necessarily restricted to that. This project is based on the groundbreaking publication *NLP from Scratch* by Dr. Ronan Collobert, but again, not restricted to that.

## Main topic of this project

This project aims to address multiple NLP tagging tasks with limited data (i.e., natural language) input with the help of multi-layer neural networks in Deep Learning.

## Keywords

Multilingual Natural Language Processing, Tagging, Deep Learning, Multi-layer Neural Networks, Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Chunking, Named Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labeling, Benchmark System, Multi-task Handling.

## Acknowledgement

This project is supported by the CMPTGCS 1L class in Fall 2022, advised by Prof. Phill Conrad at UCSB CCS. The overall direction of this project, the recommended NLP textbook, and many practical skills are all thanks to his precious guidance. Also, the author wants to thank Prof. Lei Li at UCSB CoE CS for professionally introducing many NLP resources and cutting-edge views, paving the road for the author to develop his specific project idea.
