# Peiyang-NLP-Project
## Brief introduction to this project

This project is conducted by Peiyang Song (he/him/his), an undergrad of CCS Computing in his first year. In view of his bilingual nature, this project focuses at least a little more on Mandarin NLP, but not necessarily restricted to that. This project is based on the groundbreaking publication *NLP from Scratch* by Dr. Ronan Collobert, but again, not restricted to that.
