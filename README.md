# Peiyang-NLP-Project
## Brief introduction to this project

This project is conducted by Peiyang Song (he/him/his), an undergrad of CCS Computing in his first year. In view of his multilingual nature, this project focuses at least some more on Mandarin NLP, but not necessarily restricted to that. This project is based on the groundbreaking publication *NLP from Scratch* by Dr. Ronan Collobert, but again, not restricted to that.

## Main topic of this project

This project aims to develop a unified model capable of addressing multiple NLP tagging tasks with reliance on limited data (i.e., natural language) input with the help of end-to-end multi-layer neural networks in Deep Learning. Favorable results are shown through tests in the real time and comparisons with well-established benchmarks in the industry. For more specific information about this project, please use the files in this repo according to the instructions below.

## Keywords
