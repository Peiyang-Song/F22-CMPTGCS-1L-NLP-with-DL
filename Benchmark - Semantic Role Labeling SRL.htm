A <i>semantic role</i> in language is the relationship that a
syntactic constituent has with a predicate. Typical semantic arguments
include Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc. and also adjunctive arguments
indicating Locative, Temporal, Manner, Cause, etc. aspects. Recognizing
and labeling semantic arguments is a key task for answering "Who",
"When", "What", "Where", "Why", etc. questions in Information
Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization, and, in general, in all
NLP tasks in which some kind of semantic interpretation is needed. </p>
<p> The following sentence, taken from the PropBank corpus, exemplifies
the annotation of semantic roles: </p>
<blockquote> [<sub>A0</sub> <font color="#0000ff">He</font> ] [<sub>AM-MOD</sub>
  <font color="#0000ff">would</font> ] [<sub>AM-NEG</sub> <font
 color="#0000ff"> n't</font> ] [<sub>V</sub> <b>accept</b> ] [<sub>A1</sub>
  <font color="#0000ff"> anything of value</font> ] from [<sub>A2</sub>
  <font color="#0000ff">
those he was writing about</font> ] . </blockquote>
Here, the roles for the predicate <b>accept</b> (that is, the <i>roleset</i>
of the predicate) are defined in the PropBank Frames scheme as:
<blockquote> <b>V: </b>verb<br>
  <b>A0:</b> acceptor <br>
  <b>A1:</b> thing accepted <br>
  <b>A2:</b> accepted-from <br>
  <b>A3:</b> attribute <br>
  <b>AM-MOD:</b> modal <br>
  <b>AM-NEG:</b> negation </blockquote>
<p>The Shared Tasks of CoNLL-2004 and CoNLL-2005 concerned the
recognition of semantic roles for the English
language, based on PropBank predicate-argument structures.
Given a sentence, the task consists of analyzing the propositions
expressed
by some target verbs of the sentence. In particular, for each target
verb
all the constituents in the sentence which fill a semantic role of the
verb
have to be recognized. We will refer to this problem as Semantic Role
Labeling
(SRL).</p>
<p>As in all previous CoNLL shared tasks, the general goal is to come
forward with <b>machine learning</b> strategies which address the
proposed
NLP problem, SRL in the present case. In CoNLL-2004, the goal was to
develop
SRL systems based on partial parsing information (see the main
conclusions
and system descriptions and evaluations <a href="st04/st04.html">here</a>).
In CoNLL-2005, the main focus of interest was to
increase
the amount of syntactic and semantic input information, aiming to boost
the performance of machine learning systems on the SRL task. Following
earlier editions of
the shared task, the input information contained several levels of
annotation
apart from the role labeling information: words, POS tags, chunks,
clauses,
named entities, and parse trees. All
participants were suggested to propose novel learning architectures for
better
exploiting
the data structures, relations and constraints of the problem.</p>
<p>Compared to the shared task of CoNLL-2004, the novelties introduced
in the 2005 edition were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The training corpus was substantially enlarged. This allows
to test the scalability of learning-based SRL systems to big datasets
and
compute learning curves to see how much data is necessary to train.</li>
  <li>Aiming at evaluating the contribution of full parsing in SRL, the
complete syntactic trees given by several alternative parsers was
provided
as input information for the task.</li>
  <li>In order to test the robustness of the presented systems, a
cross-corpora
evaluation was performed using fresh test sets from corpora other
than
the one used for training.</li>
  <li>Though encouraged, taking part in the closed setting was no
longer
obligatory. Thus, teams developing systems that rely intrinsically on
external
resources will be able to participate. However, no team contributed to
the open challenge.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
In both editions, participant systems were evaluated in two different
categories
depending on whether they use the information strictly contained in the
training
data (closed challenge) or they make use of external sources of
information
and/or tools (open challenge). The closed setting allows to compare
systems
under strict conditions, while the open setting aims at exploring the
contributions
of other sources of information and the limits of the current
learning-based
systems on the SRL task. Participants in the open challenge were
encouraged
to propose novel ideas for using rich semantic information, e.g.,
verbnet,
wordnet and other lexico-semantic resources, word sense disambiguation,
etc.
The use of unlabeled examples might be also considered. No system was
presented at the open challenge of the tasks.<br>
