# Peiyang NLP Project

* This project develops a unified model for multiple tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing, with a specific concentration in tagging tasks. 
* Based on a multi-layer neural network supported by an end-to-end fassion, trained by data from wikipedia for two months, this project performs better than all the traditional single-task algorithms in Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Chunking, Named Entity Recognition, and Semantic Role Labeling. 
* For more information towards this project, please find it under README.md.

## Week 1
- [ ] 1. Search for information on both CV and NLP
      For CV: Have developed a full plan with a certain level of detail
      For NLP: Have done broad research as a novice
- [ ] 2. Make decision about the research area: NLP
- [ ] 3. More precise area to research on: As a bilingual, Mandarin NLP might be a good choice (suggested by Prof. Conrad)
- [ ] 4. Research on Mandarin NLP
